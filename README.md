<h2>Follow these steps to contribute to this repo</h2>
<li>When you want to work on a GitHub project, the first step is to fork a repo.
<li>Click on the Fork button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of my repo under your GitHub user account.
<li>Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command: <br><br><b> $ git clone [url of your forked repo]</b><br><br>
<li>Now create a branch using the git checkout command:<br><br> <b>$ git checkout -b [Branch Name]</b><br><br>
<li>Append your name to the contributors list in the repo and save the changes.
<li>Add those changes to the branch you just created using the command:<br><br> <b>$ git add </b><br><br>
<li>Now commit those changes using the git commit command: <br><br><b>$ git commit -m "Adding my name to the list"</b><br><br>
<li>In order to push the changes to GitHub, we need to identify the remote’s name by the command:<br><br> <b>$ git remote</b><br><br>
<li>After identifying the remote’s name we can safely push those changes to GitHub by the command: <br><br><b>$ git push origin [Branch Name]</b><br><br>
<li>Go to your repository on GitHub and you’ll see a button “Compare & pull request” and click it. Please provide necessary details on what you’ve done. Now submit the pull request.<br><br>
